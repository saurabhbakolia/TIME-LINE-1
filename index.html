            “If you have to support yourself, you had bloody well better find
            some way that is going to be interesting.”

            James C. Collins said, “Greatness is not a function of circumstance.
            Greatness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice,
            and discipline.”

        <div class="section-content creative">

            “Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision,
            passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to
            completion,” said Jack Welch.

            “Far too many people don’t excel in life because they are too afraid
            of taking the necessary steps to achieve their dreams. Some manifest
            fear as a safeguard from failure; others don’t even try, believing
            that they are restricted by limits; while too many get caught up in
            the status quo.”
